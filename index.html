    <p>My name is David Palos and I am a third-year art student at the Claire Trevor School of the Arts<br>
        department at the University of California Irvine.  I am originally from Bellflower, California,<br>
        United States.  My central goal is and always has been to find a career in the digital production<br>
        and post-production fields of filmmaking.  This includes a variety of fields such as editing, but I<br>
        have a particular interest in visual effects artistry.  This means that although I may not be too<br>
        experienced with it, I have always had a strong interest in technology and the art that we can create<br>
        with digital mediums.  This has been the case since I was a child and was largely influenced by the<br>
        original Star Wars trilogy, which pushed the boundaries of filmmaking and found unique ways to make<br>
        their vision a reality despite having various limitations with the technology of the time.  Although I<br>
        still have a long way to go before I can begin to indulge in this kind of work, I aim to improve day by<br>
        day and I am always excited to find a new opportunity to learn about two topics that I have always been<br>
        passionate about, technology and art!</p>
